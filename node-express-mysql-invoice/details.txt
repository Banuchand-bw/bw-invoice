If you want to use sequelize-auto without creating a separate configuration file, you can pass the database connection details directly as command-line arguments. Here's how you can use sequelize-auto in Node.js with MySQL without creating a configuration file:

npx sequelize-auto -h localhost -d bw_invoice -u root -x root -e mysql -o .\app\models\

Explanation of the command:

-h specifies the host where your MySQL database is located.
-d specifies the name of your database.
-u specifies the username to access the database.
-x specifies the password for the database user.
-e specifies the database dialect (in this case, "mysql").
-o specifies the output directory where the generated models will be saved.
After running this command, sequelize-auto will connect to your MySQL database, introspect the schema, and generate Sequelize model files in the specified output directory (.\app\models\ in this example).

Once the models are generated, you can use them in your Node.js application as described in the previous responses.
